## ~~CRITICAL: Fix Universal Binary in GitHub Actions~~ ✅ RESOLVED (v1.1.20)

**Problem**: GitHub Actions releases were producing arm64-only binaries instead of universal (x86_64 + arm64) binaries.

**Root Cause**: `swift test` in release workflow was overwriting the universal binary with an arm64-only debug binary.

**Solution**: Removed test step from release workflow (tests already run in CI workflow).

**Verification**: v1.1.20 release produces true universal binary (x86_64 + arm64, 3.2M).
