## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.29] - 2025-11-01

### Added
- **System Font Protection**: Critical safety feature to prevent modifying system fonts

- **Ambiguous Name Resolution**: Ensures deterministic behavior when using `-n` flag
  - Detects when multiple font files match a provided font name
  - Fails with descriptive error listing all matching font file paths
  - Advises users to specify font by file path instead of ambiguous name
  - Prevents accidental removal of wrong font variant (e.g., Bold vs Regular)
  - Implemented in both `uninstall -n` and `remove -n` commands

### Changed
- Modified name resolution logic to collect all matches instead of using first match
- Test count: 61 ‚Üí 63 tests (added 2 system font protection tests)
