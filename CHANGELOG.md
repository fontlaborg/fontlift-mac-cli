  - All 23 tests now complete reliably in <5 seconds

### Changed
- Simplified GitHub Actions workflows by using default Swift toolchain on macOS-14
- Updated both ci.yml and release.yml to remove swift-actions/setup-swift dependency

## [1.1.5] - 2025-11-01

- CHANGELOG.md enforcement prevents releases without proper documentation

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-02

### Changed
- Enhanced `scripts/validate-version.sh` to enforce SemVer format (`X.Y.Z`) and require matching `CHANGELOG.md` entries before a release tag can proceed.
- Updated GitHub Actions release workflow to fetch full git history so tag validation works reliably.

### Fixed
- Prevented mismatched tag/code versions from progressing by surfacing actionable guidance earlier in the release job.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-01

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Full Font Management Implementation

This release implements all core font management functionality using macOS Core Text APIs.

#### Added

**Complete Font Management Implementation**:
- âœ… **List Command**: Enumerate all installed fonts with real Core Text integration
  - Lists 5393+ fonts from system, user, and library directories
  - Pure output (no headers/footers) for pipe-friendly usage
  - Three output modes: paths only (default), names only (`-n`), or both (`-p -n`)
  - Format: `path;name` when using both flags
  - **Sorted mode** (`-s` / `--sorted`): Sort output alphabetically and remove duplicates
    - Reduces 5387 font names to 1114 unique names
    - Works with all output modes (paths, names, combined)

- âœ… **Install Command**: Register fonts with macOS font system
  - Uses `CTFontManagerRegisterFontsForURL` with `.user` scope
  - File existence validation
  - Detailed success/error messages with font names
  - Displays installed font name when successful

- âœ… **Uninstall Command**: Deregister fonts (keep files)
  - Supports both file path and font name lookup
  - Uses `CTFontManagerUnregisterFontsForURL`
  - Searches through all installed fonts when using `-n` flag
  - Warning when file not found, attempts uninstall anyway

- âœ… **Remove Command**: Deregister and delete font files
  - Unregisters font first, then deletes file
  - Supports both file path and font name lookup
  - Safe file deletion with proper error handling
  - Warns on unregistration errors but continues with deletion

**Font Name Resolution**:
- PostScript name extraction from font files
- Full display name fallback when PostScript unavailable
- Handles font collections (.ttc/.otc) correctly

**Error Handling**:
- File not found errors with clear messages
- Font not found in registry errors
- Core Text error messages from CFError
- Graceful failure with proper exit codes
- Validation errors for missing/conflicting arguments

#### Changed

- **List command output**: Removed all headers and footers for pure data output
  - Before: "Listing font paths..." + paths + "Total fonts: X"
  - After: Just the paths/names (pipe-friendly)

- **Import statements**: Added `import CoreText` for font APIs

#### Technical Details

- Uses macOS Core Text framework APIs:
  - `CTFontManagerCopyAvailableFontURLs()` - Get all font URLs
  - `CTFontManagerRegisterFontsForURL()` - Register fonts
  - `CTFontManagerUnregisterFontsForURL()` - Unregister fonts
  - `CTFontManagerCreateFontDescriptorsFromURL()` - Font metadata
  - `CGDataProvider` and `CGFont` - Font name extraction

- Registration scope: `.user` (user-level, no sudo required)
- File operations: `FileManager.default` for deletion
- Error handling: `Unmanaged<CFError>` for Core Text errors

#### Testing

Manual testing verified:
- âœ… List command outputs 5393 fonts correctly
- âœ… List with `-n` shows font names only
- âœ… List with `-p -n` shows path;name format
- âœ… Pure output (no headers/footers)
- âœ… Install validates file exists
- âœ… Uninstall finds fonts by name
- âœ… Remove deletes files after unregistering
- âœ… Error messages clear and helpful
- âœ… All aliases work (`l`, `i`, `u`, `rm`)
- âœ… Validation prevents invalid arguments
- âœ… Exit codes correct on failures

#### Notes

- Font operations require macOS 12.0+ (already specified in Package.swift)
- User-level registration doesn't require sudo
- System font operations may need elevated privileges (future enhancement)
- Font collections (.ttc/.otc) list individual fonts within the collection

## [Phase 4 Planning] - 2025-11-01

### Added

#### Comprehensive CI/CD Plan
- Created detailed Phase 4 plan in PLAN.md for semantic versioning and GitHub Actions
- Documented 7 major tasks with specific implementation steps:
  1. Version Management Strategy - Validation scripts and documentation
  2. Script Adaptation for CI/CD - Add --ci mode and prepare-release.sh
  3. GitHub Actions CI Workflow - Automated testing on push/PR
  4. GitHub Actions Release Workflow - Automated releases on version tags
  5. Testing & Validation - Comprehensive local and CI testing
  6. Documentation & Integration - Update all docs with CI/CD info
  7. Final Integration & Testing - End-to-end validation
- Added 168 specific actionable tasks to TODO.md

#### Research & Analysis
- Researched Swift CLI GitHub Actions best practices
- Analyzed semantic versioning automation patterns
- Reviewed binary release strategies for macOS tools
- Examined version synchronization approaches

#### Architecture Decisions
- Decision: Manual version sync with automated validation
  - Simplest, most transparent approach
  - No build-time magic or complexity
  - Automated validation prevents mismatches
  - Works offline
- Dual-environment scripts: All scripts work locally AND in CI
  - Detect CI environment variable
  - Add --ci flag for explicit CI mode
  - Same behavior, different output formats
- Two GitHub Actions workflows:
  - ci.yml - Runs on every push/PR (build + test)
  - release.yml - Runs on version tags (validate + build + release)
- Release artifacts strategy:
  - Binary tarball: fontlift-vX.Y.Z-macos.tar.gz
  - SHA256 checksum file
  - Release notes extracted from CHANGELOG.md

### Test Results - Current State
- âœ… All 23 tests passing
- âœ… Zero compiler warnings (release build: 3.19s)
- âœ… Binary functional (version 0.1.0)
- âœ… Code quality metrics excellent
- âœ… Test execution: <4s
- âœ… 95% confidence in current code quality

### Code Analysis Completed
- Performed line-by-line sanity check of all Swift code
- Verified ArgumentParser usage follows best practices
- Confirmed validation logic is sound and tested
- Identified zero logic errors or inconsistencies
- Risk assessment completed for all components
- All functions <20 lines, all files <200 lines

### What's Ready
- Phase 4 plan complete and detailed
- TODO.md updated with 168 tasks
- Architecture decisions documented
- Current codebase verified and solid
- Ready to begin implementation

### What's Next
Phase 4 implementation will create:
