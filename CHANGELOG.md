## [Unreleased]

### Foundation Infrastructure

**Initial Release** - Swift Package structure, build automation, testing infrastructure, and documentation framework.

## [1.1.20] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Release workflow now produces true universal binaries (x86_64 + arm64)
  - Root cause: `swift test` was overwriting universal binary with arm64-only debug binary
  - Solution: Removed test step from release workflow (tests already run in CI workflow)
  - Added architecture verification to prepare-release.sh
  - Verified universal binary contains both architectures before packaging

### Changed
- Updated release workflow: Build universal â†’ Package (tests run separately in CI)
- Enhanced prepare-release.sh with universal binary validation

## [1.1.19] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- Enhanced universal binary build verification in build.sh
  - Added comprehensive validation for architecture-specific binaries
  - Verify swift build exit codes for each architecture
  - Verify final universal binary contains both x86_64 and arm64
  - Fail fast with clear error messages if verification fails
  - Added CI mode output showing architecture verification

### Changed
- Improved build.sh error handling for cross-compilation failures
- Added explicit architecture checks before and after lipo

### Added
- Documentation of universal binary issue in TODO.md and WORK.md

## [1.1.17] - 2025-11-01

### Added
- Comprehensive scripts test suite (`Tests/scripts_test.sh`) with 23 automated tests
- Tests for build.sh, test.sh, publish.sh, validate-version.sh, and get-version.sh
- Binary functionality tests (--version, --help, command help texts)
- Integrated scripts suite into main test.sh workflow

### Fixed
- Prevented `./test.sh --ci` from hanging by allowing the scripts suite to skip self-invocation during its own tests

## [1.1.10] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- Version detection fallback mechanism for build and release workflows
- Auto-fix for version mismatches in CI (via `--fix` flag)
- Git tag-based semver failure handling

### Added
- `scripts/get-version.sh` for version extraction fallback

## [1.1.9] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- Version synchronization between git tags and code
- Documentation cleanup and compression

## [1.1.8] - 2025-11-01

### Added
- Comprehensive doc comments for Install, Uninstall, Remove commands

## [1.1.7] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- Repository hygiene (added .gitignore, removed old artifacts)

## [1.1.6] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- GitHub Actions CI failure (removed Swift 6.2 installation step)
- Test hang issue in `testListWithoutArgs()`
- Version synchronization (1.1.2 â†’ 1.1.6)

## [1.1.5] - 2025-11-01

### Changed
- Cleaned up old distribution artifacts

## [1.1.4] - 2025-11-01

### Changed
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflows with improved validation

## [1.1.3] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- SemVer format enforcement in validation script

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-01
