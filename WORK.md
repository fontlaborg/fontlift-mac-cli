## GitHub Actions Failure Resolution - 2025-11-01

### Problem Analysis

**Initial State**:
- Multiple GitHub Actions workflows failing
- CI workflow: Failing
- Release workflow: Failing
- Tags v1.1.7 and v1.1.8 created but validation failing

**Root Causes Identified**:

1. **Version Mismatch** (Primary Issue)
   - Git tags: v1.1.8, v1.1.7
   - Code version: 1.1.6
   - Commits for v1.1.7 and v1.1.8 made legitimate changes but forgot to update version constant
   - Validation script correctly caught the mismatch

2. **Swift Tools Version Incompatibility** (Secondary Issue)
   - Package.swift: Required Swift 6.2
   - GitHub Actions macOS-14: Has Swift 5.10
   - Build failing with "package is using Swift tools version 6.2.0 but the installed version is 5.10.0"

3. **Missing CHANGELOG Entries**
   - v1.1.7 and v1.1.8 had no CHANGELOG documentation
   - Release workflow would fail CHANGELOG validation

### Changes Made in v1.1.7 and v1.1.8

**v1.1.7** (commit 1f03017):
- Enhanced repository hygiene
- Added comprehensive .gitignore file
- Cleaned up GitHub Actions log artifacts
- Removed obsolete test run logs

**v1.1.8** (commit a6018cd):
- Added comprehensive documentation comments for Install, Uninstall, and Remove commands
- Included detailed doc comments with usage examples
- Documented safety warnings for destructive operations
- Explained difference between uninstall (keeps file) vs remove (deletes file)

### Resolution Steps

#### Step 1: Update Version to 1.1.8 ✅

Modified `Sources/fontlift/fontlift.swift:13`:
```swift
-private let version = "1.1.6"
+private let version = "1.1.8"
```

#### Step 2: Add CHANGELOG Entries ✅

Added to `CHANGELOG.md`:
- **[1.1.8]** section documenting inline documentation improvements
- **[1.1.7]** section documenting repository cleanup

#### Step 3: Fix Swift Tools Version ✅

Modified `Package.swift:1`:
```swift
-// swift-tools-version: 6.2
+// swift-tools-version: 5.9
```

Reason: GitHub Actions macOS-14 runners have Swift 5.10, which is compatible with swift-tools-version 5.9 but not 6.2

#### Step 4: Commit and Re-tag ✅

```bash
# Commit 1: Version sync
git commit -m "fix: sync version to 1.1.8 and add missing CHANGELOG entries for v1.1.7-v1.1.8"

# Commit 2: Swift version fix
git commit -m "fix: downgrade Swift tools version from 6.2 to 5.9 for GitHub Actions compatibility"

# Delete old tag and recreate on latest commit
git tag -d v1.1.8
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.1.8
git tag -a v1.1.8 -m "Release v1.1.8"
git push origin v1.1.8
```

### Test Results

**Build Test** ✅:
```bash
./build.sh
# Build complete! (6.67s)
# Zero compiler warnings
```

**Version Verification** ✅:
```bash
.build/release/fontlift --version
# Output: 1.1.8
```

**GitHub Actions Results** ✅:

1. **CI Workflow** (run 18989012918):
   - Status: ✅ Success
   - Duration: 55 seconds
   - All tests passed

2. **Release Workflow** (run 18989015070):
   - Status: ✅ Success
   - Duration: 1m 26s
   - Validation job: ✅ Passed
   - Build job: ✅ Passed
   - Release job: ✅ Passed
   - Artifacts created: fontlift-v1.1.8-macos.tar.gz + SHA256 checksum

**Release Verification** ✅:
```bash
gh release view v1.1.8
# Title: v1.1.8
# Published: 2025-11-01T01:10:23Z
# Assets:
#   - fontlift-v1.1.8-macos.tar.gz
#   - fontlift-v1.1.8-macos.tar.gz.sha256
# Release notes: Extracted from CHANGELOG.md ✅
```

### Files Modified

1. `Sources/fontlift/fontlift.swift` - Version updated to 1.1.8
2. `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v1.1.7 and v1.1.8 entries
3. `Package.swift` - Swift tools version downgraded to 5.9

### Git History

```
Commits created:
- ff2b193 fix: downgrade Swift tools version from 6.2 to 5.9 for GitHub Actions compatibility
- 1f82b46 fix: sync version to 1.1.8 and add missing CHANGELOG entries for v1.1.7-v1.1.8

Tags updated:
- v1.1.8 moved from a6018cd to ff2b193 (latest commit)

Push history:
- Pushed main branch (2 new commits)
- Deleted old v1.1.8 tag from remote
- Pushed new v1.1.8 tag
```

### Quality Metrics

- **Build time**: 6.67s (release mode)
- **Test time**: <5 seconds (all 23 tests)
- **Compiler warnings**: 0
- **Test failures**: 0
- **CI duration**: 55s
- **Release duration**: 1m 26s
- **Binary size**: Verified in tarball

### Lessons Learned

**Version Management**:
- Must update version constant when creating git tags
- Validation script correctly catches mismatches
- CHANGELOG must have matching version section before release

**Swift Compatibility**:
- Check Swift version on GitHub Actions runners
- Use conservative swift-tools-version for CI compatibility
- Swift 5.9 is safe for macOS-14 runners

**Release Process**:
- Proper sequence: Update code → Commit → Tag → Push
- If tag needs moving, delete remote tag first, then push new tag
- GitHub Actions automatically triggers on tag push

### Confidence Level: 95%

**High confidence** in:
- Version sync resolution (validated and tested)
- Swift tools version fix (verified in CI)
- CHANGELOG completeness
- Release artifacts integrity
- All workflows passing

**5% uncertainty** from:
- Future Swift version changes on GitHub runners
- Edge cases not yet encountered

### Current Project Status

**Version**: v1.1.8 ✅
**CI/CD**: All workflows passing ✅
**Release**: Published with artifacts ✅
**Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date ✅
**Test Suite**: 23/23 tests passing ✅

### Ready for Next Development: YES ✅

All GitHub Actions failures resolved. Repository is in excellent health. Next tasks can proceed from TODO.md or PLAN.md.
