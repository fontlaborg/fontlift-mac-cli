## Current Session - 2025-11-01

### Project Status ✅

**Version**: v1.1.24
**Test Suite**: 23 Swift + 25 Script tests = 48 total tests passing
**Build**: Zero compiler warnings (release build: ~6s)
**CI/CD**: Auto-fix enabled and verified working
**Universal Binary**: ✅ FIXED - Releases now produce true universal binaries (x86_64 + arm64)
**Quality**: ✅ Enhanced - Version-agnostic tests, size validation, improved logging, file path validation
**Documentation**: ✅ Complete - Exit codes, error messages, this_file comments

### Completed Work ✅

**Phase 4 Task 1: Scripts Test Suite** (v1.1.17)
- ✅ Created comprehensive `Tests/scripts_test.sh` with 23 automated tests
- ✅ Tests cover: build.sh, test.sh, publish.sh, validate-version.sh, get-version.sh
- ✅ Binary functionality tests (--version, --help, all commands)
- ✅ Fixed recursive invocation with SKIP_SCRIPT_TESTS environment flag
- ✅ Integrated into main ./test.sh workflow
- ✅ All 46 tests passing (23 Swift + 23 Script)

**Documentation & Cleanup**
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.1.17 entry
- ✅ Cleaned up TODO.md (removed completed Task 1)
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md (marked Task 1 complete with results)
- ✅ Compressed and clarified all documentation files

**GitHub Actions Verification**
- ✅ **CI Workflow** (Run ID: 18989624171)
  - Build: Successful (14.45s)
  - Tests: All 23 Swift tests passed
  - Scripts Suite: All 23 script tests passed
  - Binary verification: Working correctly
  - Total runtime: 49s

- ✅ **Release Workflow** (Run ID: 18989610570 - v1.1.18)
  - Version validation: Auto-fix detected mismatch (tag 1.1.18 vs code 1.1.17)
  - Auto-fix: Successfully updated code version to 1.1.18
  - Warning: CHANGELOG.md missing v1.1.18 entry (expected behavior)
  - Build & Tests: All passed
  - Release creation: Successful with artifacts
  - Total runtime: 1m49s

**Conclusion**: Both CI and Release workflows functioning correctly. Auto-fix feature working as designed, detecting and correcting version mismatches automatically.

### Current Work: Fix Universal Binary Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: GitHub Actions releases produce arm64-only binaries instead of universal (x86_64 + arm64) binaries.

**Root Cause Discovered** (v1.1.19):
- Build step creates universal binary correctly ✅
- Test step runs `swift test --parallel` which rebuilds fontlift in **debug mode for native architecture only** (arm64 on GitHub Actions runners) ❌
- This **overwrites** the universal `.build/release/fontlift` binary with arm64-only binary ❌
- Prepare-release step packages the overwritten (arm64-only) binary ❌

**Solution Implemented** (v1.1.20):
1. ✅ Removed test step from release workflow
   - Tests already run in CI workflow on every push
   - No need to run tests again in release workflow
   - Prevents `swift test` from overwriting universal binary

2. ✅ Enhanced prepare-release.sh with architecture verification:
   - Verify binary contains x86_64 architecture
   - Verify binary contains arm64 architecture
   - Fail fast with clear error if not universal

3. ✅ Enhanced build.sh with comprehensive verification:
   - Verify each architecture-specific binary exists before lipo
   - Verify each binary is correct architecture
   - Verify final universal binary contains both architectures

**Verification** (v1.1.20):
```bash
$ file fontlift
fontlift: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64] [arm64]

$ lipo -info fontlift
Architectures in the fat file: fontlift are: x86_64 arm64

$ ls -lh fontlift
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  wheel  3.2M  fontlift  ✅
```

**Previous (broken) release**:
```bash
$ file fontlift  # v1.1.18
fontlift: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64  ❌

$ ls -lh fontlift
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  wheel  464K  fontlift  ❌
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Releases now produce true universal binaries

### Quality Improvements (v1.1.21) ✅

**Task 4.1: Version-Agnostic Scripts Test Suite**
- Problem: Tests had hardcoded version numbers (1.1.20)
- Solution: Extract version dynamically from source
- Benefit: Tests now work with any version - maintenance-free
- Verification: Changed version to 9.9.9 and tests still passed

**Task 4.2: Binary Size Validation in Release Process**
- Problem: Silent failures where universal build produces wrong arch
- Solution: Added size check (>1MB) and "fat file" verification
- Benefit: Catches arm64-only binaries early (464K vs 3.2M)
- Implemented in: prepare-release.sh

**Task 4.3: Enhanced Release Script Logging**
- Added: Formatted summary table with all release metrics
- Shows: Version, binary size, architectures, tarball, checksum
- Benefit: Easier verification and debugging at a glance

**Results**:
- All 46 tests passing
- v1.1.21 release successful
- Binary verified: Universal (x86_64 + arm64, 3.2M)
- Release process more robust and maintainable

---

### Additional Quality Improvements (v1.1.22) ✅

**Task 4.4: Enhanced File Path Validation**
- Problem: Generic errors when users provide invalid paths
- Solution: Created validateFilePath() with comprehensive checks
- Benefits:
  - Checks file exists before attempting operations
  - Detects directories (common mistake)
  - Validates file is readable
  - Clear, actionable error messages for each case
- Tested: nonexistent files, directories, validation works correctly

**Task 4.5: Verified this_file Comments**
- All scripts confirmed to have proper this_file comments
- Compliant with CLAUDE.md guidelines
- No changes needed - already complete

**Task 4.6: Exit Code Documentation**
- Added: Exit code documentation in README.md
- Documented: 0=success, 1=failure
- Included: Shell script examples for exit code checking
- Benefit: Better CLI integration and scripting support

**Results**:
- All 46 tests passing
- v1.1.22 release successful
- Binary verified: Universal (x86_64 + arm64, 3.2M)
- Better error messages and documentation

### Recent Work: Version Command Validation (v1.1.23) ✅

**Phase 4 Task 2: Add Version Command Validation** (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Added `fontlift verify-version` subcommand
- ✅ Compares binary version with source code version
- ✅ Detects mismatches with actionable error messages
- ✅ Added 2 new tests to scripts test suite
- ✅ All 48 tests passing (23 Swift + 25 Script)

**Implementation Details**:
- Created VerifyVersion ParsableCommand subcommand
- Uses get-version.sh to extract source code version
- Compares against compiled binary version constant
- Provides clear guidance when mismatches detected
- Intended for development/debugging use

**Results**:
- All 48 tests passing (23 Swift + 25 Script tests)
- v1.1.23 ready for release
- Binary verified: Universal (x86_64 + arm64)
- Version validation working correctly

### Recent Work: Enhanced Error Messages (v1.1.24) ✅

**Phase 4 Task 3: Enhance Error Messages** (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Reviewed all error messages in fontlift.swift
- ✅ Added file paths to all error messages
- ✅ Added "Common causes" sections with specific troubleshooting steps
- ✅ Added sudo guidance for permission errors
- ✅ Added `fontlift list -n` suggestions for font name errors
- ✅ Added fc-cache suggestion for font database errors
- ✅ Tested error scenarios manually to verify helpfulness

**Implementation Details**:
- Install command: Provides troubleshooting for installation failures
- Uninstall command: Suggests checking installed fonts with list command
- Remove command: Detailed guidance for file deletion permission issues
- Font not found: Suggests verifying names and checking spelling/case
- System errors: Includes recovery suggestions (fc-cache)

**Testing**:
- Manually tested file not found scenario
- Manually tested font name not found scenario
- All 48 tests still passing (23 Swift + 25 Script)
- Error messages verified to be clear and actionable

**Results**:
- All 48 tests passing
- v1.1.24 ready for release
- Binary verified: Universal (x86_64 + arm64)
- Error messages significantly improved
- Users now get specific guidance for common issues
