### Current Work: Fix Universal Binary Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: GitHub Actions releases produce arm64-only binaries instead of universal (x86_64 + arm64) binaries.

**Root Cause Discovered** (v1.1.19):
- Build step creates universal binary correctly ✅
- Test step runs `swift test --parallel` which rebuilds fontlift in **debug mode for native architecture only** (arm64 on GitHub Actions runners) ❌
- This **overwrites** the universal `.build/release/fontlift` binary with arm64-only binary ❌
- Prepare-release step packages the overwritten (arm64-only) binary ❌

**Solution Implemented** (v1.1.20):
1. ✅ Removed test step from release workflow
   - Tests already run in CI workflow on every push
   - No need to run tests again in release workflow
   - Prevents `swift test` from overwriting universal binary

2. ✅ Enhanced prepare-release.sh with architecture verification:
   - Verify binary contains x86_64 architecture
   - Verify binary contains arm64 architecture
   - Fail fast with clear error if not universal

3. ✅ Enhanced build.sh with comprehensive verification:
   - Verify each architecture-specific binary exists before lipo
   - Verify each binary is correct architecture
   - Verify final universal binary contains both architectures

**Verification** (v1.1.20):
```bash
$ file fontlift
fontlift: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64] [arm64]

$ lipo -info fontlift
Architectures in the fat file: fontlift are: x86_64 arm64

$ ls -lh fontlift
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  wheel  3.2M  fontlift  ✅
```

**Previous (broken) release**:
```bash
$ file fontlift  # v1.1.18
fontlift: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64  ❌

$ ls -lh fontlift
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  wheel  464K  fontlift  ❌
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Releases now produce true universal binaries

---

### Quality Improvements (v1.1.21) ✅

**Task 4.1: Version-Agnostic Scripts Test Suite**
- Problem: Tests had hardcoded version numbers (1.1.20)
- Solution: Extract version dynamically from source
- Benefit: Tests now work with any version - maintenance-free
- Verification: Changed version to 9.9.9 and tests still passed

**Task 4.2: Binary Size Validation in Release Process**
- Problem: Silent failures where universal build produces wrong arch
- Solution: Added size check (>1MB) and "fat file" verification
- Benefit: Catches arm64-only binaries early (464K vs 3.2M)
- Implemented in: prepare-release.sh

**Task 4.3: Enhanced Release Script Logging**
- Added: Formatted summary table with all release metrics
- Shows: Version, binary size, architectures, tarball, checksum
- Benefit: Easier verification and debugging at a glance

**Results**:
- All 46 tests passing
- v1.1.21 release successful
- Binary verified: Universal (x86_64 + arm64, 3.2M)
- Release process more robust and maintainable

---

### Additional Quality Improvements (v1.1.22) ✅

**Task 4.4: Enhanced File Path Validation**
- Problem: Generic errors when users provide invalid paths
- Solution: Created validateFilePath() with comprehensive checks
- Benefits:
  - Checks file exists before attempting operations
  - Detects directories (common mistake)
  - Validates file is readable
  - Clear, actionable error messages for each case
- Tested: nonexistent files, directories, validation works correctly

**Task 4.5: Verified this_file Comments**
- All scripts confirmed to have proper this_file comments
- Compliant with CLAUDE.md guidelines
- No changes needed - already complete

**Task 4.6: Exit Code Documentation**
- Added: Exit code documentation in README.md
- Documented: 0=success, 1=failure
- Included: Shell script examples for exit code checking
- Benefit: Better CLI integration and scripting support

**Results**:
- All 46 tests passing
- v1.1.22 release successful
- Binary verified: Universal (x86_64 + arm64, 3.2M)
- Better error messages and documentation
