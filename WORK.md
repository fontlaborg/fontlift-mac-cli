## Current Session - 2025-11-01

### Project Status ✅

**Version**: v1.1.20
**Test Suite**: 23 Swift + 23 Script tests = 46 total tests passing
**Build**: Zero compiler warnings (release build: ~22s)
**CI/CD**: Auto-fix enabled and verified working
**Universal Binary**: ✅ FIXED - Releases now produce true universal binaries (x86_64 + arm64)

### Completed Work ✅

**Phase 4 Task 1: Scripts Test Suite** (v1.1.17)
- ✅ Created comprehensive `Tests/scripts_test.sh` with 23 automated tests
- ✅ Tests cover: build.sh, test.sh, publish.sh, validate-version.sh, get-version.sh
- ✅ Binary functionality tests (--version, --help, all commands)
- ✅ Fixed recursive invocation with SKIP_SCRIPT_TESTS environment flag
- ✅ Integrated into main ./test.sh workflow
- ✅ All 46 tests passing (23 Swift + 23 Script)

**Documentation & Cleanup**
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.1.17 entry
- ✅ Cleaned up TODO.md (removed completed Task 1)
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md (marked Task 1 complete with results)
- ✅ Compressed and clarified all documentation files

**GitHub Actions Verification**
- ✅ **CI Workflow** (Run ID: 18989624171)
  - Build: Successful (14.45s)
  - Tests: All 23 Swift tests passed
  - Scripts Suite: All 23 script tests passed
  - Binary verification: Working correctly
  - Total runtime: 49s

- ✅ **Release Workflow** (Run ID: 18989610570 - v1.1.18)
  - Version validation: Auto-fix detected mismatch (tag 1.1.18 vs code 1.1.17)
  - Auto-fix: Successfully updated code version to 1.1.18
  - Warning: CHANGELOG.md missing v1.1.18 entry (expected behavior)
  - Build & Tests: All passed
  - Release creation: Successful with artifacts
  - Total runtime: 1m49s

**Conclusion**: Both CI and Release workflows functioning correctly. Auto-fix feature working as designed, detecting and correcting version mismatches automatically.

### Current Work: Fix Universal Binary Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: GitHub Actions releases produce arm64-only binaries instead of universal (x86_64 + arm64) binaries.

**Root Cause Discovered** (v1.1.19):
- Build step creates universal binary correctly ✅
- Test step runs `swift test --parallel` which rebuilds fontlift in **debug mode for native architecture only** (arm64 on GitHub Actions runners) ❌
- This **overwrites** the universal `.build/release/fontlift` binary with arm64-only binary ❌
- Prepare-release step packages the overwritten (arm64-only) binary ❌

**Solution Implemented** (v1.1.20):
1. ✅ Removed test step from release workflow
   - Tests already run in CI workflow on every push
   - No need to run tests again in release workflow
   - Prevents `swift test` from overwriting universal binary

2. ✅ Enhanced prepare-release.sh with architecture verification:
   - Verify binary contains x86_64 architecture
   - Verify binary contains arm64 architecture
   - Fail fast with clear error if not universal

3. ✅ Enhanced build.sh with comprehensive verification:
   - Verify each architecture-specific binary exists before lipo
   - Verify each binary is correct architecture
   - Verify final universal binary contains both architectures

**Verification** (v1.1.20):
```bash
$ file fontlift
fontlift: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64] [arm64]

$ lipo -info fontlift
Architectures in the fat file: fontlift are: x86_64 arm64

$ ls -lh fontlift
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  wheel  3.2M  fontlift  ✅
```

**Previous (broken) release**:
```bash
$ file fontlift  # v1.1.18
fontlift: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64  ❌

$ ls -lh fontlift
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  wheel  464K  fontlift  ❌
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Releases now produce true universal binaries

### Next Tasks 🎯

**Phase 4 Task 2: Add Version Command Validation**
- Add runtime version check in main CLI
- Compare binary version with actual code version
- Warn if mismatch detected (for development builds)
- Add test for version consistency

**Phase 4 Task 3: Enhance Error Messages**
- Review all error messages in fontlift.swift
- Add specific file paths in errors
- Add actionable suggestions for common mistakes
- Test error scenarios
